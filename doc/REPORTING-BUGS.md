# Reporting bugs

There are couple of ways to report a problem:

  - primary channel is an e-mail conference ultragrid-dev@cesnet.cz
    which leads to developers of UltraGrid
  - you can use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/CESNET/UltraGrid/issues)
    for reporting bugs. You need to register, but it is only matter
    of filling username and password.

In order to allow us detect the problem more precisely, you can send us
also output of diagnostic script (_data/ultragrid-bugreport-collect.sh_
in sources or in program data dir once installed).

If the problem is a crash (SEGV), you can send also a core dump and a
binary (if you compiled by yourself, otherwise package version).
