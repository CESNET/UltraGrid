UltraGrid video service plugin for AccessGrid v2.2 
==================================================

The plugin will be built as part of the normal UltraGrid compilation.  

To install the UltraGrid receiver, copy ag_plugin/uvReceiverService.zip into
/etc/AccessGrid/NodeServices and restart AccessGrid. When VenueClient starts, 
go into "Preferences -> Manage My Node" and add the "UltraGrid Receiver". 

To install the UltraGrid sender, copy ag_plugin/uvSenderService.zip into
/etc/AccessGrid/NodeServices and restart AccessGrid. When VenueClient starts,
go into "Preferences -> Manage My Node" and add the "UltraGrid Sender". 

When upgrading the plugin, be sure to remove any old versions installed in
both /etc/AccessGrid/NodeServices and $HOME/.AccessGrid/local_services
